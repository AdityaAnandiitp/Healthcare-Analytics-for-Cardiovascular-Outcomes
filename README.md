# Healthcare-Analytics-for-Cardiovascular-Outcomes

This is a data analytics project where I have analysed large datasets of patients to identify trends in Cardiovascular risk factors.
The key details of the project is as follows-

– Developed an analysis model for heart failure detection on 900+ patient records, focusing on cardiovascular risk factors.

– Performed impactful Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, and statistical methods for insightful data assessment and cleaning through Univariate/multivariate analysis.

– Implemented effective Data Visualization Techniques (Matplotlib & Seaborn) to communicate findings, aiding in comprehensive understanding and decision-making.
